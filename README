Based on the Django Locking plugin at stdbrouw/django-locking.  
Forked to fix a number of issues and add in functionality to show and edit locks in list mode.

Installation through Pip (pip install django-locking)

Configuration:

1) Add locking to list of INSTALLED_APPS in project settings file

2) Add locking js/css/image media files to admin media folder

3) Add the following Media elements in the app admin file to correspond with the media folder:
Note: If using a newer version of django-grappelli (e.g. 2.3.5), you may have to create an alternate variable in
the settings file that doesn't point to the grappelli folder (i.e. STANDARD_ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX)

class Media:
  js = ( ...,
    settings.ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX + "locking/js/jquery.url.packed.js",
  	"/ajax/admin/variables.js",
		settings.ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX + "locking/js/admin.locking.js?v=1")

  css = ( ...,
    "all": ( ...,
      settings.ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX + "locking/css/locking.css",
    
    )
  )

4) To use the list display icon, add the "get_lock_for_admin" method to the list display in the admin class for the app. Also, so the changelist view has access to the request object, it has to be explicitly passed:

	from locking import admin as locking_admin
	
	class ModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
		
		get_lock_for_admin = locking_admin.get_lock_for_admin
	
		list_display = [field1, field2, ..., 'get_lock_for_admin']
		
	    def changelist_view(self, request, extra_context=None):
			'''
			We need the request objects in a few places where it's usually not present,
			so we are adding it to ModelAdmin object
			'''
			self.request = request
			return super(ModelAdmin, self).changelist_view(request, extra_context)


5) Run syncdb for an initial project or create a migration with south to build the database tables

  manage.py schemamigration locking --auto
  manage.py migrate locking
